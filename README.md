# SaaS Foundations

A modern, production-ready SaaS starter with built-in auth, teams, subscriptions, blog, docs, and more.

## The Problem

Let's discuss here on the [Problem](https://github.com/rjvim/saas-foundations/issues/1)

Building a SaaS product requires numerous peripheral features beyond your core offering:

- Authentication
- Team management
- Subscription billing
- Documentation
- Blog
- Landing pages
- SEO optimization

These features are essential but time-consuming to build from scratch for each new project.

SaaS Foundations provides all these capabilities out of the box, allowing you to focus on your unique product features.
