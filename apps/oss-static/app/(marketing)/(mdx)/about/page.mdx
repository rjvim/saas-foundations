Hey, I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** at Company. I focus on building fast, accessible, and visually polished front-end experiences using tools like **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and whatever cool thing just dropped on GitHub.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and powered by [Fumadocs](https://fumadocs.vercel.app/), which makes writing pages in Markdown feel like second nature. It lets me focus on content without wrestling with layout.

### Journey

I didn't grow up writing code. In fact, I didn't even know what a `<div>` was until much later. My curiosity started with tweaking themes on forums, editing little bits of CSS without knowing what CSS even meant.

Eventually, that curiosity turned into late nights spent debugging JavaScript errors and falling in love with how code could bring ideas to life.

I started building side projects, contributing to open source, and slowly leveling up. My first "real" job involved wrangling legacy jQuery code. It wasn't glamorous, but it taught me the fundamentals — and just how far modern frameworks have come.

Since then, I've worked across startups and mid-sized teams, shipped production code to thousands of users, and mentored new developers along the way.
